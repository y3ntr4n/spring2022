//Every single Java file should start with package keyword and package name.
//Package keyword's purpose is simple: To declare under which package this class is created in.
//this will be used comments.
//in comment lines developers can write anything (we can write keywords as well)
//Java keywords will be ignored.
//ex; class.package.

package com.java.class03;
//public -> access modifier
//access modifier -> keyword which defines which classes this class or methods can be used.
//4 access modifiers types
    //1. public
    //2. default (we don't type anything)
    //3. protected
    //4. private

//Classes -> can only use 2 access modifiers -> public and default.
//if your class is public your class must match with the fileName.
//order must be as follows:
//access modifier class ClassName {

public class SecondClass {

    //what is main method?
    //Every program must have at least one main method.
    //main method is a starting point of an application.
    //methods are functionalities.
    // when we start the program java behind the scenes (under the hood)
    //looks for a method with name main.
    public static void main(String[]args) {

        //print out to console
        //semicolons are used to end a statement
        //a statement is a sentence and semi colon is a period.
        System.out.println("I am super excited");
        System.out.println("My favorite quote: \"Be Kind\"");

    }
}

//file format -> every program uses certain type of file formats.
//ex: word document -> .docx
//ex: pictures -> .jpeg, .png
//ex: presentations -> .pdf, .ppt
//ex: plain text -> .txt
//ex: video -> .mp4, .avi, .vod
//ex: audio -> mp3
//ex: excel -> .xlsx
//compressed file -> .zip, .tar, .rar
//executable file -> .exe

//{ -> open curly brace
//} - close curly brace
//Curly braces always come in pairs -> they define the scope of a class, method, statement.

//Dynamic -> it can change
//Static -> it cannot change

//IDE -> Integrated Development Environment
